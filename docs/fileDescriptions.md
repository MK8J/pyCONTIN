* CONTINWrapper.py: the collection of functions that provids the interface between python and CONTIN package. For example of how to put together these functions , see testgenInputFile()
* readcontin.py: this file is for initial devlopement. It reads the xdata and ydata from ```contin.in``` that comes with the original CONTIN package and make a plot.
* testCONTINWrapper.py: it contains several unit test functions for CONTINWrapper.py
* paramTemplate.txt: a csv file contating the default parameters for CONTIN main program. This parameter file will be loaded by the python wrapper and convereted to the user-setting parameters in the input file for CONTIN.in.

* IO data for test/: this folder contatins several input and output files for testing the python CONTIN wrapper or CONTIN main program itself.
* ord_err_abs_blocksample.txt: contains one "block" of CONTIN output data, this is for testing readblock function
* ord_err_abs_blocksample.txt: same as above, but has two blocks of data
* mySimulatedTest.in: an input file with default setting. The data is generated by single exponentail calculation
* contin_part1.in: a modification of the first part of data in ```contin.in```. Some parameters are modified so that it runs inverse Lapalce transformation instead.
